# Creating a vue app

## Ininitialize vue project with vite
Vue comes bundled with vite in vue3 so you can write the configuration file (package.json) with the help of the vue cli tool.
```
> npm init vue@latest
```

After the tool finished you can change into your project directory and install your project dependencies.
```
> cd <your-project-name>
> npm install
```
